###### [ 1.0.32 ] - 2025/01/17

  * Fixed issue with random track playing if shuffle mode was on while selecting a track favorite.  To fix, I had to disable shuffle prior to starting play of the track as the Spotify Web API would always play a shuffled track.  The only other alternative was to just play 1 track, which would then end play when the song ended.
  * Fixed play button icon sizing when player is idle.

###### [ 1.0.31 ] - 2025/01/14

  * Added "Play All Track Favorites" action to the track favorites section actions.  This will get a list of the tracks saved in the current Spotify user's 'Your Library' and starts playing them, with shuffle enabled.
  * Added logic to player `PREVIOUS_TRACK` control so that if more than 8 seconds have passed the currently playing track is just restarted from the beginning; otherwise, the previous track is selected if progress is past the 8 second point.

###### [ 1.0.18 ] - 2024/12/11

  * This release requires the SpotifyPlus Integration v1.0.69+ release; please make sure you update the SpotifyPlus integration prior to updating this SpotifyPlus Card release.

###### [ 1.0.17 ] - 2024/12/09

  * This release requires the SpotifyPlus Integration v1.0.69+ release; please make sure you update the SpotifyPlus integration prior to updating this SpotifyPlus Card release.
  * Modified the media list items' text color to use the `--spc-medialist-items-color` variable (defaults to `white`) instead of the `--secondary-text-color`, as well as the title and sub-title background gradient.  Media list item text was difficult to read using certain themes.
  * Disabled `Categories` section by default when adding instance from card picker.  Spotify Web API functionality was deprecated unexpectedly (and without prior notice!) by the Spotify Development Team.
  * Updated underlying `turn_on` service to first check if the previously selected source is active or not; if so, then play is resumed immediately; if not, then a `source_select` is performed to activate the selected source.  This result in a faster time to play when powering on the media player.
  * Updated various underlying `SpotifyClient` methods to discard favorites that do not contain a valid URI value.  Sometimes the Spotify Web API returns favorite items with no information, which causes exceptions in the card while trying to display them!  The following methods were updated: `GetAlbumFavorites`, `GetEpisodeFavorites`, `GetShowFavorites`, `GetTrackFavorites`.

###### [ 1.0.16 ] - 2024/12/06

  * This release requires the SpotifyPlus Integration v1.0.68+ release; please make sure you update the SpotifyPlus integration prior to updating this SpotifyPlus Card release.
  * Added "Active User" information to Spotify Connect Device details display.

###### [ 1.0.15 ] - 2024/12/02

  * This release requires the SpotifyPlus Integration v1.0.67+ release; please make sure you update the SpotifyPlus integration prior to updating this SpotifyPlus Card release.
  * Some Spotify Web API functionality has been deprecated unexpectedly (and without prior notice!) by the Spotify Development Team, and has affected SpotifyPlus Card functionality.  More information can be found on the [SpotifyPlus Card Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/thlucas1/spotifyplus_card/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide#issue---sam1010e-deprecated-error-messages) wiki page, as well as the [Spotify Developer Forum Blog](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api).
  * Due to the above chnages made by Spotify, any Algorithmic and Spotify-owned editorial playlists are no longer accessible or have more limited functionality.  This means that you can no longer obtain details via the `SpotifyClient.GetPlaylist` and `SpotifyClient.GetPlaylistItems` methods for Spotify-owned / generated content (e.g. "Made For You", etc).  A `404 - Not Found` error will be returned when trying to retrieve information for these playlist types.
  * Added category shortcut capability to user-defined presets. This will allow you to quickly display category playlists.  This change is irrelevant though, as the support for category playlists was deprecated by the above Spotify Development team changes to their API!
  * I am leaving the deprecated functionality within the card for the time being, with the hope that Spotify changes it's mind and restores the functionality.

###### [ 1.0.14 ] - 2024/11/25

  * Non-Administrator accounts can now use the card without receiving the `unauthorized` message.  Note that non-administrators cannot change the card configuration (as designed).
  * Changed the way calls are made to the underlying SpotifyPlus integration services.  Calls are now made using the `hass.callService` method instead of the `hass.connection.sendMessagePromise` with type `execute_script`.  This was causing all calls that returned service response data to fail with `unauthorized` errors.
  * Removed references to `custom-card-helpers` npm package, as it was outdated and is not being maintained.  We will now create our own card helpers when needed.
  * Added reference to `home-assistant-js-websocket` version 9.4.0, as it was a dependency of `custom-card-helpers` npm package.

###### [ 1.0.13 ] - 2024/11/20

  * This release requires the SpotifyPlus Integration v1.0.66+ release; please make sure you update the SpotifyPlus integration prior to updating this SpotifyPlus Card release.
  * Added "Copy Preset Info to Clipboard" action for track and artist in the player track details action menu.  This will create a user-preset configuration entry for the selected media and copy it to the clipboard; the entry can then be pasted into the configuration editor under the `userPresets:` key, which will create a user preset for the media item.
  * Added "Copy Preset Info to Clipboard" action for track and artist in the favorites track details action menu.  This will create a user-preset configuration entry for the selected media and copy it to the clipboard; the entry can then be pasted into the configuration editor under the `userPresets:` key, which will create a user preset for the media item.
  * Added "Show Album Tracks" action for all album action menus.  This will display all tracks on the album in the search browser.
  * Added "Connect / Login to this device" action menu item to Spotify Connect device browser action menu. This will add the device to the Spotify Connect player device list.
  * Added "Disconnect / Logout from this device" action menu item to Spotify Connect device browser action menu. This will remove the device from the Spotify Connect player device list.
  * Fixed a bug in userpreset details display that was causing an error alert of "MediaItem not set in updateActions" when a userpreset with type "recommendations" was selected.

###### [ 1.0.12 ] - 2024/11/15

  * Added category browser: browse Spotify playlists by categories; existing card configurations have to enable the section in the general configuration settings.
  * Added dynamic track recommendation capability to user-defined presets. Simply put, you define a preset with the parameters of what you want to play and Spotify searches its media catalog for tracks that match. The matching tracks are then added to a play queue and played in random order. The matching tracks will change over time, as Spotify adds new content to its media catalog.
  * Added action for all playable media types: Copy Preset Info to Clipboard.  This will create a user-preset configuration entry for the selected media and copy it to the clipboard; the entry can then be pasted into the configuration editor under the `userPresets:` key, which will create a user preset for the media item.
  * Updated artist details to show more information about the artist.  Note that actions menu can be used to display more artist-related details (albums, top tracks, etc).
  * Added artist action: show artist albums; lists only the artist albums (no compilations, no appears on, no singles, etc).
  * Added artist action: show artist album compilations; lists only the artist compilation albums (no appears on, no singles, etc).
  * Added artist action: show artist albums appears on (aka collaborations); lists only the artist appears on albums (no compilations, no singles, etc).
  * Added artist action: show artist album singles; lists only the artist single release albums (no compilations, no appears on, etc).
